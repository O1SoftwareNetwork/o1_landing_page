            <h2>Appliance Repair</h2>
            <p>This project is aimed at providing an entry-level access to building mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC skills. Those who join begin at an entry-level position with minimal training (enough to get started) performing simple repairs on simple devices and appliances and learn as they go. As they complete more repairs, they receive access to further education learning more complex and advanced repairs on more difficult to fix devices/appliances eventually leading to computational devices.</p>
